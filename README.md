# TriviaGame


#  Purpose
This project is a 5 question trivia game that provides the player with 25 seconds to answer all the trivia questions.  It then provides feedback to the user and lets them know how many question that got correct, incorrect, and left unaswered.

#  Getting Started
To get started you press the New Game Button.  This will activate our on click event which then calls the countDown function to start the timer, and the loadQuestions function to set up the questions on the page.  

Once the timer is up the app will call each checkAnswer function and then load the gameOver function, which displays the score to the user.
